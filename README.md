# starvars

The goal of starvars is to estimate a Vector Logistic Smooth Transition model in R. The package allows also the user to test non-linearity and determine common structural breaks in multivariate time series. Furthermore, realized covariances and their Cholesky decomposition may be obtained through a dedicated function.
